          <h1>SAINTS HAD NO UNDERWEAR</h1>
          <p>Lips, hands, feet, breasts — these all are beautiful parts of our magnificent bodies.</p>
          <p>However, there is a different point of view in the conservative society. That is why the reality may be so warped, that it scares.</p>
          <p>Billion dollar industry of beauty and fashion tells women to expose their breasts, to have a surgery, to put on a push-up bra.</p>
          <p>Those who sexualise natural body parts are blaming women for being provocative and acting like sluts because of the outfits they wear.</p>
          <p>Religious beliefs are putting restrictions not only on what to wear but also on how to think about the body, making natural things shameful.</p>
          <p>All these beliefs stay in minds of millions of women, making them feel guilty because of their bodies.</p>
          <p>
            People don’t even think how harmful a regular bra is. It blocks blood circulation, overheats breasts causing the
            risk of having cancer. Underwires and straps are bringing pain and leaving red marks on soft skin.
            And the whole concept of breasts “supporting” conversely makes muscles loose their natural tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Society doesn’t know how many women become victims of sexual abuse and harassment, because it’s always easier
            to blame women for having their bodies rather than admit the fact that some people are uneducated, rude and ill-mannered.
          </p>
          <p>Even more people don’t understand that breasts are not a sin or an evil, but exactly the same body part as others.</p>
          <p>Woman is neither a slave of a culture, nor a servant of someone’s desires.</p>
          <p>Woman has a right to decide on her own what to do with her body. </p>
          <p>No one has a right to blame a woman for a decision that she's made.</p>
